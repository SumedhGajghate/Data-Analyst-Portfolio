# Sumedh Gajghate- Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Sumedh! I have a background in Industrial Design and am currently pursuing my B.Tech in this field. Over the course of my studies, I've developed a strong foundation in both design principles and data analytics. My passion lies in merging creativity with data-driven insights to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.

During my academic journey, I've honed my skills in analyzing complex data and developed a keen eye for detail, which I believe are essential in the field of data analytics. I've also gained experience in using various data analysis tools and techniques, which I am eager to apply as I venture further into this field.

In my free time, I love exploring new data visualization techniques and learning about emerging trends in data science. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I am motivated by the challenge of solving complex problems and the satisfaction of turning data into actionable insights.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
