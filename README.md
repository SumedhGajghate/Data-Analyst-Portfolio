# Sumedh Gajghate- Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Sumedh! I have a background in Industrial Design and am currently pursuing my B.Tech in this field. Over the course of my studies, I've developed a strong foundation in both design principles and data analytics. My passion lies in merging creativity with data-driven insights to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.

During my academic journey, I've honed my skills in analyzing complex data and developed a keen eye for detail, which I believe are essential in the field of data analytics. I've also gained experience in using various data analysis tools and techniques, which I am eager to apply as I venture further into this field.

In my free time, I love exploring new data visualization techniques and learning about emerging trends in data science. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I am motivated by the challenge of solving complex problems and the satisfaction of turning data into actionable insights.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Retail Data Exploration: Identifying Key Sales Patterns and Customer Segments
**Code:** [`Data Exploration: Identifying Key Sales Patterns and Customer Segments`](https://github.com/SumedhGajghate/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/master/Customer%20shopping%20analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** Identify visitor demographics and top-selling categories to improve marketing and inventory.

**Description:**  Conducted a retail data analysis using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn within Jupyter Notebook on VS Code. The analysis revealed that female visitors account for 75% of the total visitor base, with clothing and cosmetics being the top-selling categories. The project involved data cleaning and univariate, bivariate, time series, and multivariate analyses.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, statistical analysis.

**Technology:**  Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code.

**Results:** The analysis showed that female visitors represent 75% of the base, with clothing and cosmetics as top-selling categories.


### Hardware Brand Revenue and Market Insightss
**Code:** [`Hardware Brand Revenue and Market Insights`](https://github.com/SumedhGajghate/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/master/BI%20dashboard.pdf)

**Goal:** Identify revenue distribution and market trends for hardware brands to inform strategic decisions.

**Description:**  Conducted a hardware brand revenue analysis using a methodical approach. Utilized AIMS grid for planning, MySQL for data preparation and cleaning, and connected Power BI to SQL Server. Performed ETL using Power Query and created dashboards with Power BI. Key insights: over 68% of revenue comes from a single city, and revenue peaks in the 3rd and 4th quarters.

**Skills:** data preparation, data cleaning, ETL processes, data visualization, market analysis.

**Technology:**  AIMS grid, MySQL, Power BI, SQL Server, Power Query.
